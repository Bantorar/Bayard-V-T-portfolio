    "text": "Data Description\nThis project uses real-world global economic and defense data. It combines military expenditure, total GDP, and GDP per capita by country and region from 1960 to 2018. The source data comes from the World Bank’s public databases on military and economic indicators.\n\n\nData Cleaning\nTo clean the data, I transformed the datasets from a wide format into a long format so each row represents a single country and year. I removed unnecessary columns, renamed variables to make them easier to understand, and merged different datasets together so each row includes military spending, GDP, and GDP per person. I also filtered the data to focus on countries and specific regions of interest, such as income groups or geographic zones.\n\n\nVisualization 1\nThis chart shows how GDP and military expenditure have changed across global regions over time. Each dot represents a specific region in a specific year. The vertical position shows how large the economy was, while the size of the dot represents how much was spent on the military. Different colors are used to distinguish the regions.\n\n\n\n\n\nGDP and Military Expenditure Over Time by Region\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization 2\nThis bar chart compares military spending between income groups for two selected years: 1989 and 2018. Each bar shows the military budget of an income group, and the color of each bar represents that group’s GDP per person. This allows us to see not just who spends more on the military, but how that compares to the economic level of each group.\n\n\n\n\n\nMilitary Spending by Income Group in 1989 and 2018"
